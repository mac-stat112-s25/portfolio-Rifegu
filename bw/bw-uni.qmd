Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization.
The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)


# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true

head(hikes)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true

head(hikes)
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
 geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill= "steelblue", color= "green") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")+
    theme_minimal()
```

## **Making a histogram for elevation and number of hikes:**

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

## **Making a density plot for elevation:**

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(fill= "pink", alpha=0.5)+
  labs(title = "Elevation Density Plot", subtitle = "Distribution of Hike Elevations")

```

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```

> ### Is the graph effective?
>
> All of the graphs (bar, histogram and density) are effective.
> Each have different functions.
> The bar chart shows how we can estimate on average how many hikes depending on the rating of the hikeâ€” easy, moderate, difficult.
> We observe that when the rating is moderate there are more hikes.
>
> The histogram is effective in showing specifically on the elevations there are more hikes.
> And the density plot shows the probability of hikes taken on specific elevation.
> I believe density plot is much better- yet this depends on what we are researching.
