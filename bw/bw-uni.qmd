Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

## **Making a histogram for hike rating and number of hikes:**

```{r}

#| eval: true

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

#| eval: true

head(hikes)


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill= "steelblue", color= "green") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")+
    theme_minimal()

#Making a histogram for elevation and number of hikes:


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

#Making a density plot for elevation:


ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(fill= "pink", alpha=0.5)+
  labs(title = "Elevation Density Plot", subtitle = "Distribution of Hike Elevations")



#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")

##Is the graph effective?

#All of the graphs (bar, histogram and density) are effective. Each have different functions. The bar chart shows how we can estimate on average how many hikes depending on the rating of the hikeâ€” easy, moderate, difficult. We observe that when the rating is moderate there are more hikes. 

#The histogram is effective in showing specifically on the elevations there are more hikes. And the density plot shows the probability of hikes taken on specific elevation. I believe density plot is much better- yet this depends on what we are researching.
